# flashlearn.github.io
##A Crowdsourced Flashcard Platform

We were inspired to create Flash Learn largely due to our own difficulties finding resources to study with. There are many resources out there with a lot of information, and there are some resources that help you study your own information. Yet there is virtually nothing out there that lets you study a vast amount of information in a focused way. We saw this gap and decided it needed to be filled.
